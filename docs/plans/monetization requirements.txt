ReelBallers Monetization Spec

Model: Pay-Per-Render Using “Render Minutes”

1. Monetization Philosophy (Non-Functional Requirement)

Users pay only for GPU-intensive operations:

Framing

Highlight Overlay

Any combined “final render” pipeline

All non-GPU features remain accessible without payment:

Annotation

Clip DB

Query-based highlight assembly

Preview playback

Monetization must feel:

Outcome-based (“I paid for this result”)

Transparent (no surprise charges)

Fair (clear link between cost and processing)

2. Billing Unit: Render Minutes
Definition

Render Minute = 1 minute of finished video processed through GPU-intensive rendering.

Render Minutes are consumed only when a final render is executed, not during previews or drafts.

Scope

Render Minutes apply to:

Dynamic framing

AI upscaling

Highlight overlay

Any combined pipeline that invokes GPU rendering

Render Minutes do not apply to:

Annotation

Clip tagging

Query-based clip selection

Timeline edits without rendering

Preview-quality playback

3. Render Cost Calculation (User-Facing Requirement)

Before a render starts, the system must:

Calculate:

Total output duration (in minutes, rounded up to nearest 0.1 or 0.5)

Render Minutes required

Display clearly:

“This render will use X Render Minutes”

If user does not have enough Render Minutes:

Block render

Present purchase flow

4. Render Minutes Packages
Requirements

Render Minutes must be purchasable in simple, round bundles

Prices must be displayed in USD

Packages should scale with a volume discount

Example Package Structure (Editable)
Package Name	Render Minutes	Price
Starter	10 minutes	$10
Standard	25 minutes	$20
Power	60 minutes	$40

NOTE: These values are placeholders — pricing can be tuned later without changing system logic.

5. Free Allocation (Optional but Supported)

System should support:

One-time or recurring free Render Minutes

Example use cases:

New user onboarding

Monthly allowance

Promotional credits

Requirements:

Free Render Minutes are consumed before paid minutes

UI should label them clearly (e.g. “Free Render Minutes”)

6. Render Consumption Rules
Core Rules

Render Minutes are deducted:

Once per unique final render

At render start or render completion (choose one, but be consistent)

Re-downloading or re-sharing a completed render:

Must not consume additional Render Minutes

Re-rendering after changes:

Consumes Render Minutes again (new output)

Caching Requirement

Identical renders (same inputs + settings) should:

Be recognized

Not double-charge if re-accessed

7. User Balance Management
System Must Track

For each user:

Total Render Minutes purchased

Render Minutes remaining

Render Minutes consumed (audit log)

Display Requirements

User must be able to see:

Current Render Minutes balance

Estimated Render Minutes required before rendering

Render history (timestamp, minutes used, output reference)

8. Purchase Flow (Stripe)
Requirements

Stripe Checkout or Stripe Elements

One-time purchases (no subscription required)

Support:

Credit card

Apple Pay / Google Pay (if enabled in Stripe)

Flow

User attempts render

System checks balance

If insufficient:

Modal or page:

“You need X Render Minutes”

Package options

On successful Stripe payment:

Render Minutes are credited immediately

User returns to render confirmation

9. UI Surface Areas (High-Level)
A. Render Confirmation Screen

Must show:

Output duration

Render Minutes required

Render Minutes available

CTA:

“Render Highlight” (enabled)

“Buy Render Minutes” (if insufficient)

B. Purchase Screen

Must show:

What Render Minutes are

What they are used for

Available packages

Stripe checkout entry point

C. Account / Usage Screen

Must show:

Remaining Render Minutes

Render history

Link to purchase more

10. Error & Edge Case Handling
Required Behaviors

If render fails:

Render Minutes must not be consumed

If render partially completes:

Either:

No charge, or

Partial charge (choose one globally)

(Strong recommendation: no charge unless successful)

11. Abuse & Cost Control (Non-UI Requirements)

System must support:

Hard caps per render

Rate limiting for concurrent renders

Admin override of user balances

Ability to disable rendering for an account

12. Tech Stack Alignment (Constraints Only)

Implementation must:

Use Stripe for payments

Store balances in existing DB (Cloudflare-backed)

Be accessible from React/Vite frontend

Be enforceable server-side (Python / Unicorn)

Never trust client-side balance checks alone

13. Language & Copy Guidelines (Important)

Always use:

“Render Minutes” (not credits)

“Processing” or “Rendering” (not “AI compute”)

“Final highlight” (not “GPU job”)

Example copy:

“Rendering applies professional framing and player highlighting. This takes time and compute, which is why it uses Render Minutes.”

14. Explicit Non-Requirements (Do NOT Build Yet)

No subscriptions

No per-feature pricing

No dynamic pricing

No refunds automation

No marketplace or bundles tied to seasons

These can be layered later.

15. Success Criteria

This monetization system is successful if:

Users can create value without paying

Payment happens at the moment of perceived magic

Render costs are predictable

GPU costs scale linearly with revenue

Parents understand exactly what they paid for
