# RIFE Frame Interpolation
#
# This directory contains the RIFE (Real-time Intermediate Flow Estimation)
# model for high-quality slow motion frame interpolation.
#
# RIFE is NOT included in this repository - it must be installed separately.
#
# To install RIFE, run from the project root:
#   ./scripts/setup_rife.sh
#
# This will clone: https://github.com/hzwer/ECCV2022-RIFE
# and download the model weights.
#
# Without RIFE, the system automatically falls back to FFmpeg's minterpolate
# filter, which provides acceptable but lower quality slow motion.
